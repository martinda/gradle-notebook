= Task with inputs

In GNU Make, the inputs to a rule are the pre-requisites. When the
pre-requisites timestamp becomes younger than the target's, GNU Make
will re-run the recipe to regenerate the target file. If the inputs
change but the target remains younger than all its pre-requisites, GNU
Make will not re-run rebuild the target, eventhough it may be out of sync
with the pre-requisites. In practice, this does not cause problems often.

In Gradle, task inputs are not limited to files. Task inputs can be file
names, file content, directory names or content, strings, etc.

Let's start with a simple task with one input file:

[source,groovy,linenums]
----
include::build.gradle[tags=all]
----
<1> We define `MyTask` as an extension of the `DefaultTask`
<2> We create an instance of the task with one input file
<3> We create an instance of the task without no input file
